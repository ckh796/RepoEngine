# RepoEngine

RepoEngine is a modern SwiftUI iOS app that lets users search and browse GitHub repositories with a clean architecture and responsive UI. It demonstrates best practices in MVVM, dependency injection, pagination, and async data loading.

## To enable unit testing, set isUnitTesting to true in Config.swift

##  Features

- GitHub repository search with live debounce filtering
- Dark/Light mode
- Image Caching
- Detailed repository view with avatar, stars, and creation date
- Infinite scroll / pagination
- Unit-testable architecture with mocked data source
- Clean UI with SwiftUI + Combine
- Loading indicators and error handling
- Splash screen on launch
- Keyboard dismissal on scroll or tap
- Modal-based repository detail presentation (`.sheet`)

##  Architecture

- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel pattern
- **Dependency Injection**: `RepositoryProviding` protocol allows injecting mock or real implementations
- **Combine**: Handles search debounce, loading states, and reactive bindings
- **SwiftUI**: Entire UI built with SwiftUI, using `NavigationStack`, `.sheet`, and `@StateObject`
